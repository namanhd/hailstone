( -- * Audio nodes
  --
  -- | An audio `Node` is a unit of computation with a state, and carries a signal function
  -- that reads and updates the state and emits a value. A `Node` can have child nodes whose
  -- emitted values are fed into the parent, forming a tree of nodes.
  --
  -- Check the constructors for the minimal set of axiomatic nodes that cover our evaluation
  -- needs; check `mkNode1` `mkNode3` for some derived constructors with other arities.
  --
  -- The audio node /tree/ can become an audio node /graph/ (a DAG, to be specific) with the
  -- use of `share`, which uses sorcery to enable /observable sharing/, letting the embedded
  -- DSL see the sharing semantics, the let-bindings & usage of names, of the host language.

-- * Audio nodes

{-|
Audio Node tree; each node packs a state (of whatever state type @s@) together with a signal
function that can operate on that state to emit a value and a new state. The type @e@ is for
any outside-world information that nodes need access to.

(These constructors are for different arity cases. We only need up to 2, then arities higher
than two are easily decomposed into binary functions).

There are a number of design decisions here...

- Q: Why can't we get away with just a `MkNode0` that can do everything?

    - A: While it's true that you can write an Applicative instance such that any n-ary func
      can just be represented as a MkNode0 that emits that function applied to other MkNode0
      that emit arguments, such a function will __not__ be able to modify the state based on
      these arguments. (i.e. the function is confined to the applicative's \"pure slot\" and
      cannot \"reach outwards\" and affect the node state, a necessity for modeling e.g. the
      sine oscillator carrying an angle state (which must update node state based on emitted
      frequency values from an argument node.)

- Q: Why do we need `MkNode2`? Why not @MkNode1@, since the @a@ in @`SF` a s x@ could be any
  compound type, including a tuple such as @(f, a)@ like what's seen with `MkNode2`?

    - A: It turns out you can model a great many things with a two-argument node, especially
      function application, plus allowing an almost trivial applicative instance w/ @liftA2@
      and @\<*\>@ both admitting efficient definitions. To write @mkNode2@ & the applicative
      from only @MkNode1@ would involve spawning new nodes that do plumbing plus hard-coding
      @(,) \<$\> aNode \<*\> bNode@ (i.e. wrapping up two nodes into one tuple-emitting node
      in order to get tree-like branching via tuple types.)

- Q: This is a binary tree... One usually hears of audio graphs, not audio node trees. Is it
  possible to represent audio node graphs i.e. forking a node output to feed multiple nodes?

    - A: With some cursed magic to implement __observable sharing__ in `share`, yes. That is
      the general way to hijack the host language's sharing and make it manifest in the EDSL
      embedded within it, without having to make the DSL type a monad (which we don't have).

- Q: Why are there separate stateless variants of `MkNode0` and `MkNode2`?

    - A: We can model `MkNode0_` and `MkNode2_` with the stateful counterparts, but this has
      some cost (the dummy state @()@ being created or passed around for function calls). As
      we're trying to be as efficient as possible, we specialize as much as possible.

-- ** Observable sharing

data OshCache a = MkOshCached {-# UNPACK #-} !TimeVal !a | MkOshNothing

-- | Uses `unsafePerformIO` to allow a node to cache its output, keyed by current time. If a
-- cache-supporting node is run with a new @t@ /different/ from the @t@ of the current cache
-- value, the cache is cleared & refreshed with a value computed from the signal function.
--
-- This gives /observable sharing/: let-binding a caching node, and using that bound name as
-- the child of other nodes, lets those nodes effectively use the same cached value which is
-- now only ever calculated upon its first use once every new sampling step (i.e. upon every
-- new value of @t@).
--
-- BEWARE: a tree node \"shadowed\" by a never-miss cache lookup due to a copy of itself run
-- before it in the depth-first (postorder) tree walk will /never/ get any state updated, as
-- it is never actually /evaluated/, and state is not part of the value being cached.
--
-- This does not matter, because they nonetheless always yield the right value thanks to the
-- cache, but if it ever becomes possible for the tree to change between time steps & states
-- do not get reset by this change, then we might run into wrong states being used. Also any
-- printing of node tree states will yield the wrong states for these always-shadowed nodes.
--
-- CAVEAT: this has a bit of overhead (`unsafePerformIO` and the `IORef` both incur a cost),
-- though it will be beneficial for most nontrivial nodes and especially ones that are piped
-- into many other nodes as arguments. Do profiling to inform judgment of whether `share` is
-- helping or not, because it can be non-obvious.
